  The restaurant project employs user role-based authentication with three distinct roles. 
  The first role is the "Admin," responsible for providing user credentials (user ID and password) to each restaurant. 
  Restaurants, designated as the second role, can manage employee records and showcase their food items on the restaurant's homepage. 
  Users, the third role, have the option to register, enabling them to place orders at their preferred restaurants.
  Unregistered users can view restaurant details and menu items but are unable to place orders.
  This structure ensures secure access and tailored functionalities for administrators,  
  restaurants, and end-users within the restaurant project.
